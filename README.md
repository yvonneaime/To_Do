# To_Do
This is the updated version of my To-Do List Application.
Option 1-- Extend TWO previous projects, adding additional features.
Two new components in this project-- inclusive of a state and an interface element for user input (no static components).

(Updated Features): 
- Setting deadline for tasks using the Calender/ Set Date feature 
    (The deadline will be displayed in the Details Screen)
- Add a Comment Component which allows you to further explain the details of your tasks 
- Deletion of tasks 
    (It will be marked completed or incompleted in the Details Screen)
